        <h1 id="title"><strong>CIS 155:</strong> Welcome to Cameroon</h1>
        <p>Cameroon is a country located in Central Africa, just above the equator. It covers an area of approximately
            475,000 square kilometers
            and has an estimated population of around 30 million people. Often referred to as "Africa in miniature,"
            Cameroon boasts a remarkable cultural
            and geographical diversity that mirrors the continent as a whole. It is home to over 250 ethnic groups and
            languages, which contribute to its rich and vibrant cultural mosaic.
            <br>
            Geographically, the country spans four distinct regions: the coastal plains in the southwest, the
            mountainous highlands in the west,
            the forested southern plateau, and the northern savannahs. Mount Cameroon, an active volcano near the Gulf
            of Guinea, is the highest peak in West and Central Africa,
            rising to over 4,000 meters. The country's diverse ecosystems range from tropical rainforests to arid
            Sahelian zones, supporting a wide array of flora and fauna.
            <br>
            Cameroon is one of only two countries in the world with both French and English as official languages, a
            legacy of its colonial history
            under both French and British administration following Germany's defeat in World War I. This bilingualism is
            reflected in its legal and educational systems,
            and it plays a central role in the nation's identity and political landscape.
            <br>
            The economy of Cameroon is diverse, with key sectors including agriculture, oil and gas, mining, and
            services.
            The country is a leading producer of cocoa, coffee, cotton, and bananas, and its cultural festivals, music,
            and cuisine are celebrated across the region for their richness and variety.
            <br>
            Despite its natural wealth and cultural assets, Cameroon faces challenges related to governance, economic
            inequality, and regional tensions,
            particularly between its Anglophone and Francophone regions. Nevertheless, it remains a vital and
            influential nation within the Central African sub-region
            and continues to play a key role in regional integration and stability.

            <h2 class="subtitle1">Cameroon History</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Cameroon has a rich history that dates back thousands of years, with early civilizations like the Sao
                thriving near Lake Chad
                and numerous ethnic groups forming kingdoms and chiefdoms such as the Bamoun in the west and Fulani
                emirates in the north.
                European contact began with Portuguese explorers in the 15th century, but it wasn't until 1884 that
                Germany formally colonized the territory as Kamerun.
                After Germany's defeat in World War I, the land was divided between France and Britain under League of
                Nations mandates.
                French Cameroon gained independence in 1960, followed by the unification with Southern British Cameroons
                in 1961, forming the Federal Republic of Cameroon.
                The federation was abolished in 1972, creating a unitary state. Since 1982, Paul Biya has ruled the
                country, overseeing a shift to multi-party politics in the 1990s,
                though his long tenure has been marked by allegations of authoritarianism. In recent years, Cameroon has
                faced major challenges, particularly the Anglophone Crisis,
                where English-speaking regions have demanded greater autonomy or independence due to perceived
                marginalization. Despite these issues,
                Cameroon remains a culturally rich and strategically important country in Central Africa, with over 250
                ethnic groups and both French and English as official languages.

            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">The Origine of The Name Cameroon</h3>
            <p>
                The name Cameroon originates from the Portuguese word "Camarões," which means "shrimps" or "prawns."
                When Portuguese explorers arrived on the coast of present-day Cameroon in the 15th century,
                they sailed up the Wouri River (near present-day Douala). There, they encountered an abundance of giant freshwater shrimp.
                 In 1472, the Portuguese navigator Fernão do Pó (also known as Fernão do Poo) named the river "Rio dos Camarões" , meaning "River of Shrimps."
                 <br>
                 Over time, this name evolved through different languages:
                 <ul>
                    <li> The Spanish called it “Camarones”</li>
                    <li>The Germans later adopted “Kamerun” during their colonization</li>
                    <li>The French used “Cameroun”</li>
                    <li>The English version became “Cameroon”</li>
                 </ul>
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2"> Before Colonization </h3>
            <p>
                Before colonization, the territory now known as Cameroon was home to a wide range of ethnic groups,
                kingdoms, and civilizations, each with its own unique culture,
                language, and political systems. One of the earliest known civilizations was the Sao culture, which
                thrived around Lake Chad from about the 6th to the 15th century,
                leaving behind impressive artifacts and architecture. In the north, powerful Islamic states such as the
                Kanem-Bornu Empire and later the Adamawa Emirate (established by the Fulani during the 19th-century
                jihads)
                dominated trade and politics, spreading Islam and maintaining vast networks across West and Central
                Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the west and central highlands, ethnic groups like the Bamileke, Bamoun, and Tikar developed
                centralized kingdoms with complex social hierarchies, strong military structures,
                and vibrant artistic traditions. The Bamoun Kingdom, for example, was known for its skilled diplomacy,
                military strength, and unique script created by Sultan Njoya in the early 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the coast, the Duala people established themselves as key middlemen in trade between the interior
                and European merchants. By the 15th century, Portuguese explorers arrived,
                followed by the Dutch, British, and French, trading goods such as ivory, palm oil, and later slaves.
                Despite growing European contact, local rulers maintained political control for centuries,
                adapting to and influencing external relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cameroon's pre-colonial period was thus marked by diversity, trade, migration, and cultural development,
                laying the foundations for the complex society that would later experience European colonization in the
                late 19th century.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">During Colonization (1884-1960)</h3>
            <p>
                Cameroon's colonial period began in 1884 when Germany signed treaties with local chiefs along the coast,
                officially establishing the colony of Kamerun. The Germans expanded their control inland,
                developing infrastructure such as roads, railways, and plantations, especially for cocoa, bananas, and
                rubber. However, their rule was harsh—marked by forced labor, land seizures,
                and violent suppression of resistance, including uprisings by the Bassa, Bakoko, and Ewondo peoples.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Germany's defeat in World War I, its colonies were divided among the victorious powers. In 1919,
                Kamerun was split into two parts: French Cameroon, which took the majority of the territory, and British Cameroon,
                which was administered in two parts (Northern and Southern Cameroons) alongside Nigeria.
                This division was formalized under League of Nations mandates, later becoming United Nations Trust Territories after World War II.
            </p>
            <p>
                French Cameroon was governed as part of France's assimilationist colonial system, with tighter control and centralized administration.
                British Cameroons, in contrast, were ruled indirectly through Nigerian colonial structures, receiving less investment in development.
                During this time, nationalist movements began to grow. In French Cameroon, the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), founded in 1948,
                called for independence and reunification of the divided territories, but it was banned in 1955, leading to an armed uprising that was brutally suppressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the late 1950s, under increasing pressure from nationalist groups and the global push for decolonization, France agreed to grant independence.
                French Cameroon became independent on January 1, 1960, with Ahmadou Ahidjo as its first president.
                In 1961, Southern British Cameroons voted in a UN-organized plebiscite to join the newly independent Cameroon, marking the beginning of reunification.
