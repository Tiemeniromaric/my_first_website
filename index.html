            <p>
                To ensure a smooth and efficient experience with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you'll need to install a
                few essential extensions.
                These extensions will enhance your coding environment, make your workflow easier, and provide useful
                tools such as
                syntax highlighting, debugging support, and code formatting.
                <br>
                In addition, some of these extensions will allow you to view your webpage live in a browser as you are
                typing,
                giving you immediate feedback and making it easier to see how your changes affect the design and
                functionality.
                <br>
                Throughout this setup guide, you'll learn which extensions are required for the course and how to
                install and configure them properly.
                Taking a few minutes to complete this step will greatly improve your productivity and help you get the
                most out of your development experience.

                <li class="subtitle2">Install Live Server</li>
