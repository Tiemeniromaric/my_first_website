        <p>Cameroon is a country located in Central Africa, just above the equator. It covers an area of approximately
            475,000 square kilometers
            and has an estimated population of around 30 million people. Often referred to as "Africa in miniature,"
            Cameroon boasts a remarkable cultural
            and geographical diversity that mirrors the continent as a whole. It is home to over 250 ethnic groups and
            languages, which contribute to its rich and vibrant cultural mosaic.
            <br>
            Geographically, the country spans four distinct regions: the coastal plains in the southwest, the
            mountainous highlands in the west,
            the forested southern plateau, and the northern savannahs. Mount Cameroon, an active volcano near the Gulf
            of Guinea, is the highest peak in West and Central Africa,
            rising to over 4,000 meters. The country's diverse ecosystems range from tropical rainforests to arid
            Sahelian zones, supporting a wide array of flora and fauna.
            <br>
            Cameroon is one of only two countries in the world with both French and English as official languages, a
            legacy of its colonial history
            under both French and British administration following Germany's defeat in World War I. This bilingualism is
            reflected in its legal and educational systems,
            and it plays a central role in the nation's identity and political landscape.
            <br>
            The economy of Cameroon is diverse, with key sectors including agriculture, oil and gas, mining, and
            services.
            The country is a leading producer of cocoa, coffee, cotton, and bananas, and its cultural festivals, music,
            and cuisine are celebrated across the region for their richness and variety.
            <br>
            Despite its natural wealth and cultural assets, Cameroon faces challenges related to governance, economic
            inequality, and regional tensions,
            particularly between its Anglophone and Francophone regions. Nevertheless, it remains a vital and
            influential nation within the Central African sub-region
            and continues to play a key role in regional integration and stability.

            <h2 class="subtitle1">Cameroon History</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Cameroon has a rich history that dates back thousands of years, with early civilizations like the Sao
                thriving near Lake Chad
                and numerous ethnic groups forming kingdoms and chiefdoms such as the Bamoun in the west and Fulani
                emirates in the north.
                European contact began with Portuguese explorers in the 15th century, but it wasn't until 1884 that
                Germany formally colonized the territory as Kamerun.
                After Germany's defeat in World War I, the land was divided between France and Britain under League of
                Nations mandates.
                French Cameroon gained independence in 1960, followed by the unification with Southern British Cameroons
                in 1961, forming the Federal Republic of Cameroon.
                The federation was abolished in 1972, creating a unitary state. Since 1982, Paul Biya has ruled the
                country, overseeing a shift to multi-party politics in the 1990s,
                though his long tenure has been marked by allegations of authoritarianism. In recent years, Cameroon has
                faced major challenges, particularly the Anglophone Crisis,
                where English-speaking regions have demanded greater autonomy or independence due to perceived
                marginalization. Despite these issues,
                Cameroon remains a culturally rich and strategically important country in Central Africa, with over 250
                ethnic groups and both French and English as official languages.

            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">The Origine of The Name Cameroon</h3>
            <p>
                The name Cameroon originates from the Portuguese word "Camarões," which means "shrimps" or "prawns."
                When Portuguese explorers arrived on the coast of present-day Cameroon in the 15th century,
                they sailed up the Wouri River (near present-day Douala). There, they encountered an abundance of giant
                freshwater shrimp.
                In 1472, the Portuguese navigator Fernão do Pó (also known as Fernão do Poo) named the river "Rio dos
                Camarões" , meaning "River of Shrimps."
                <br>
                Over time, this name evolved through different languages:
            <ul>
                <li> The Spanish called it “Camarones”</li>
                <li>The Germans later adopted “Kamerun” during their colonization</li>
                <li>The French used “Cameroun”</li>
                <li>The English version became “Cameroon”</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2"> Before Colonization </h3>
            <p>
                Before colonization, the territory now known as Cameroon was home to a wide range of ethnic groups,
                kingdoms, and civilizations, each with its own unique culture,
                language, and political systems. One of the earliest known civilizations was the Sao culture, which
                thrived around Lake Chad from about the 6th to the 15th century,
                leaving behind impressive artifacts and architecture. In the north, powerful Islamic states such as the
                Kanem-Bornu Empire and later the Adamawa Emirate (established by the Fulani during the 19th-century
                jihads)
                dominated trade and politics, spreading Islam and maintaining vast networks across West and Central
                Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the west and central highlands, ethnic groups like the Bamileke, Bamoun, and Tikar developed
                centralized kingdoms with complex social hierarchies, strong military structures,
                and vibrant artistic traditions. The Bamoun Kingdom, for example, was known for its skilled diplomacy,
                military strength, and unique script created by Sultan Njoya in the early 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the coast, the Duala people established themselves as key middlemen in trade between the interior
                and European merchants. By the 15th century, Portuguese explorers arrived,
                followed by the Dutch, British, and French, trading goods such as ivory, palm oil, and later slaves.
                Despite growing European contact, local rulers maintained political control for centuries,
                adapting to and influencing external relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cameroon's pre-colonial period was thus marked by diversity, trade, migration, and cultural development,
                laying the foundations for the complex society that would later experience European colonization in the
                late 19th century.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">During Colonization (1884-1960)</h3>
            <p>
                Cameroon's colonial period began in 1884 when Germany signed treaties with local chiefs along the coast,
                officially establishing the colony of Kamerun. The Germans expanded their control inland,
                developing infrastructure such as roads, railways, and plantations, especially for cocoa, bananas, and
                rubber. However, their rule was harsh—marked by forced labor, land seizures,
                and violent suppression of resistance, including uprisings by the Bassa, Bakoko, and Ewondo peoples.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Germany's defeat in World War I, its colonies were divided among the victorious powers. In 1919,
                Kamerun was split into two parts: French Cameroon, which took the majority of the territory, and British
                Cameroon,
                which was administered in two parts (Northern and Southern Cameroons) alongside Nigeria.
                This division was formalized under League of Nations mandates, later becoming United Nations Trust
                Territories after World War II.
            </p>
            <p>
                French Cameroon was governed as part of France's assimilationist colonial system, with tighter control
                and centralized administration.
                British Cameroons, in contrast, were ruled indirectly through Nigerian colonial structures, receiving
                less investment in development.
                During this time, nationalist movements began to grow. In French Cameroon, the Union des Populations du
                Cameroun (UPC), founded in 1948,
                called for independence and reunification of the divided territories, but it was banned in 1955, leading
                to an armed uprising that was brutally suppressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the late 1950s, under increasing pressure from nationalist groups and the global push for
                decolonization, France agreed to grant independence.
                French Cameroon became independent on January 1, 1960, with Ahmadou Ahidjo as its first president.
                In 1961, Southern British Cameroons voted in a UN-organized plebiscite to join the newly independent
                Cameroon, marking the beginning of reunification.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">Independence and Early Years(1960-1972)</h3>
            <p>
                Cameroon gained independence from France on January 1, 1960, becoming the Republic of Cameroon with
                Ahmadou Ahidjo as its first president.
                Ahidjo focused on building national unity, economic development, and centralizing power. On October 1,
                1961, following a UN-organized plebiscite,
                the British-administered Southern Cameroons voted to join the Republic of Cameroon, while Northern
                Cameroons chose to join Nigeria.
                This led to the creation of the Federal Republic of Cameroon, consisting of East Cameroon (Francophone)
                and West Cameroon (Anglophone), each with a degree of autonomy.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">Craetion of Unitary State (1972)</h3>
            <p>
                In 1972, a national referendum abolished the federal system, and Cameroon became a unitary state known
                as the United Republic of Cameroon.
                This change was intended to promote unity but also reduced the autonomy of the Anglophone regions,
                planting seeds of future discontent.
                Ahidjo continued to rule with a centralized and authoritarian style, maintaining stability but limiting
                political freedoms.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">Transition of Power and Biya's Rise (1982-1900)</h3>
            <p>
                In 1982, President Ahidjo unexpectedly resigned and handed power to his Prime Minister, Paul Biya.
                Though the transition was peaceful, tensions later grew between Ahidjo and Biya.
                Biya faced early challenges, including a failed coup attempt in 1984. That same year, the country was
                renamed the Republic of Cameroon, and the name of the state returned to its pre-1961 form,
                further alienating many in the Anglophone regions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">Multi-Party Politics and Political Tensions (1990s-2000s)</h3>
            <p>
                Mounting pressure from the public and the international community led to a return to multi-party
                democracy in 1990.
                The first multi-party presidential election was held in 1992, but it was marred by allegations of fraud.
                Paul Biya and his party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM),
                have remained in power ever since through elections that are regularly criticized for lacking
                transparency and fairness.
                During this period, Cameroon experienced some economic reforms and infrastructure development, but
                widespread corruption and authoritarian practices persisted.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">The Anglophone Crisis (2016-Present)</h3>
            <p>
                Since 2016, tensions between the Anglophone regions (Northwest and Southwest) and the central government
                have escalated into a serious conflict.
                What began as peaceful protests by Anglophone lawyers and teachers against marginalization and the
                dominance of French in courts and schools turned into an armed struggle.
                Separatist groups declared an independent state called Ambazonia, leading to violent clashes with
                government forces, human rights abuses, internal displacement, and a humanitarian crisis.
                Dialogue attempts have so far been limited and largely unsuccessful.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">Recents Developments (2020s-Present)</h3>
            <p>
                President Paul Biya, now in his 93s, remains in power as one of the world's longest-serving heads of
                state. His government continues to face criticism for lack of democratic reforms, suppression of
                dissent, and mishandling of the Anglophone crisis. Despite challenges, Cameroon maintains relative
                stability compared to some of its neighbors and plays an important role in Central African regional
                politics.
                <br>
                At the same time, the country deals with economic difficulties, youth unemployment, corruption, and
                security threats from Boko Haram in the Far North. Calls for political transition, peaceful dialogue,
                and inclusive governance continue to grow as the country looks to its future.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle1">The Four Major Cultural Groups In Cameroon</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">Fang-Beti in The South</h3>
            <img src="Images/Cameroon/Groups/Fang-Beti-Kings.jpg" alt="Fang-Beti Kings">
            <img src="Images/Cameroon/Groups/Fang-Beti-Culture1.jpg" alt="Fang-Beti culture">
            <img src="Images/Cameroon/Groups/Fang-Beti-Culture2.jpg" alt="Fang-Beti Culture">
            <p>
                The Fang-Beti,also called Beti-Pahuin—are a large Bantu-speaking ethnic group found mainly in Cameroon,
                Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. In Cameroon, they are concentrated in the Centre, South, and East regions.
                The group is made up of closely related sub-groups such as the Beti, Bulu, Eton, Ewondo, and Fang, who
                share linguistic, cultural, and historical ties. Their language cluster belongs to the Bantu family, and
                dialects like Ewondo and Bulu are widely spoken and used as local lingua francas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, the Fang-Beti migrated from northern or savannah regions to the southern forest zones,
                possibly around the 17th century, settling in more fertile areas. They developed strong clan-based
                social structures, with patrilineal lineage systems and village life centered around family and
                community leadership. Traditional beliefs focused on ancestor worship, spiritual forces, and
                rituals—though many Fang-Beti today practice Christianity, often blended with indigenous customs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Culturally, the Fang-Beti are known for their wood carvings, masks, and rich oral traditions, including
                proverbs, storytelling, and music. Some masks, like the "Ngil" mask among the Fang, were used in secret
                societies for justice and initiation. Politically, the Fang-Beti—especially the Beti and Bulu—have had
                significant influence in modern Cameroonian politics, with several leaders, including President Paul
                Biya, coming from this group. Today, they continue to play a vital role in the country's cultural and
                political life, while also working to preserve and promote their heritage through festivals and
                education
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle2">Grass-Field in The west</h3>
            <p>
                The Grassfields region—also known as the Western Highlands or Bamenda Grassfields—is a mountainous,
                fertile area in western Cameroon. It is home to numerous related ethnic groups, including the Bamileke,
                Bamum, Tikar, Nso, Kom, Bafut, Babungo, Bali-Nyonga, and others. Archaeological evidence shows that
                people have inhabited the area for thousands of years, transitioning from hunter-gatherer societies to
                settled farming communities. Many of the groups trace their origins to ancient migrations, especially
                from the north and central parts of Cameroon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Politically, Grassfields societies are traditionally organized into fondoms or chiefdoms, each ruled by
                a fon (king or traditional ruler). These leaders are supported by councils of nobles and elders and are
                often seen as both political and spiritual heads. Lineage and ancestry are central to their identity,
                with many communities claiming descent from common ancestors, especially in relation to the Tikar origin
                theory, which suggests that many Grassfields groups migrated from the Tikar Plain in central Cameroon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The region is known for its linguistic diversity, with dozens of local languages spoken across different
                fondoms. These languages belong to the Grassfields Bantu group of the Niger-Congo language family. Most
                people in the area speak multiple languages due to close contact between neighboring communities.
                Economically, the Grassfields people are mostly farmers, growing crops like yams, maize, cassava,
                plantains, and groundnuts, as well as engaging in small-scale animal husbandry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Art and culture are vital parts of life in the Grassfields. The royal palaces (or “Grande Cases”) of the
                fondoms are important cultural and spiritual centers, often decorated with wooden carvings, beaded
                items, and sacred objects. The people are well known for their masks, dance traditions, ritual
                ceremonies, and festivals, which often honor ancestors or mark key events such as funerals, royal
                succession, or community celebrations. These artistic expressions are deeply tied to their belief
                systems and social structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern times, Grassfields societies have adapted to colonial and post-independence changes. Many
                fondoms continue to exist and hold significant influence, particularly in customary law, land issues,
