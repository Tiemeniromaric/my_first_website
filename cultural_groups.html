                The Fang-Beti,also called Beti-Pahuin—are a large Bantu-speaking ethnic group found mainly in Cameroon,
                Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. In Cameroon, they are concentrated in the Centre, South, and East regions.
                The group is made up of closely related sub-groups such as the Beti, Bulu, Eton, Ewondo, and Fang, who
                share linguistic, cultural, and historical ties. Their language cluster belongs to the Bantu family, and
                dialects like Ewondo and Bulu are widely spoken and used as local lingua francas.</p>
            <p>
                Historically, the Fang-Beti migrated from northern or savannah regions to the southern forest zones,
                possibly around the 17th century, settling in more fertile areas. They developed strong clan-based
                social structures, with patrilineal lineage systems and village life centered around family and
                community leadership. Traditional beliefs focused on ancestor worship, spiritual forces, and
                rituals,though many Fang-Beti today practice Christianity, often blended with indigenous customs.</p>
            <p>
                Culturally, the Fang-Beti are known for their wood carvings, masks, and rich oral traditions, including
                proverbs, storytelling, and music. Some masks, like the "Ngil" mask among the Fang, were used in secret
                societies for justice and initiation. Politically, the Fang-Beti—especially the Beti and Bulu—have had
                significant influence in modern Cameroonian politics, with several leaders, including President Paul
                Biya, coming from this group. Today, they continue to play a vital role in the country's cultural and
                political life, while also working to preserve and promote their heritage through festivals and
                education.

            <p>
                The Grassfields region—also known as the Western Highlands or Bamenda Grassfields—is a mountainous,
                fertile area in western Cameroon. It is home to numerous related ethnic groups, including the Bamileke,
                Bamum, Tikar, Nso, Kom, Bafut, Babungo, Bali-Nyonga, and others. Archaeological evidence shows that
                people have inhabited the area for thousands of years, transitioning from hunter-gatherer societies to
                settled farming communities. Many of the groups trace their origins to ancient migrations, especially
                from the north and central parts of Cameroon.</p>
            <p>
                Politically, Grassfields societies are traditionally organized into fondoms or chiefdoms, each ruled by
                a fon (king or traditional ruler). These leaders are supported by councils of nobles and elders and are
                often seen as both political and spiritual heads. Lineage and ancestry are central to their identity,
                with many communities claiming descent from common ancestors, especially in relation to the Tikar origin
                theory, which suggests that many Grassfields groups migrated from the Tikar Plain in central Cameroon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The region is known for its linguistic diversity, with dozens of local languages spoken across different
                fondoms. These languages belong to the Grassfields Bantu group of the Niger-Congo language family. Most
                people in the area speak multiple languages due to close contact between neighboring communities.
                Economically, the Grassfields people are mostly farmers, growing crops like yams, maize, cassava,
                plantains, and groundnuts, as well as engaging in small-scale animal husbandry.</p>

        <section class="section3">
            <p>

                Art and culture are vital parts of life in the Grassfields. The royal palaces (or “Grande Cases”) of the
                fondoms are important cultural and spiritual centers, often decorated with wooden carvings, beaded
                items, and sacred objects. The people are well known for their masks, dance traditions, ritual
                ceremonies, and festivals, which often honor ancestors or mark key events such as funerals, royal
                succession, or community celebrations. These artistic expressions are deeply tied to their belief
                systems and social structure.</p>
            <p>
                In modern times, Grassfields societies have adapted to colonial and post-independence changes. Many
                fondoms continue to exist and hold significant influence, particularly in customary law, land issues,
                and cultural preservation. The people have also become increasingly integrated into national political
                and economic life, with many from the region migrating to cities for education, work, and trade. Despite
                these changes, efforts are ongoing to preserve local languages, traditions, and identities in the face
                of modernization and globalization.</p>

            <p>
                The Sudano-Sahelian cultural group is found primarily in the northern regions of Cameroon, including the
                Adamawa, North, and Far North regions. This group lives in the Sudano-Sahelian ecological zone,
                characterized by savannah grasslands, dry climates, and seasonal rainfall. The people in this region are
                highly diverse, both ethnically and linguistically, and include major groups such as the Fulani (or
                Peul), Massa, Tupuri, Mafa, Mandara, Musgum, Kotoko, and many others.</p>

            <p>The Fulani are the largest and most influential group in this area. Originally nomadic pastoralists, many
                Fulani in Cameroon have settled and are involved in cattle rearing and trade. Their Islamic faith
                strongly influences their culture, law, education, and social systems. Traditional leaders among the
                Fulani are known as lamidos, who rule over lamidats (chiefdoms) with both religious and political
                authority, especially in towns like Garoua, Ngaoundéré, and Maroua.</p>
            <p>Other ethnic groups in the Sudano-Sahelian zone have distinct traditions, languages, and livelihoods.
                Many communities are involved in agriculture, growing crops such as millet, sorghum, cotton, and
                groundnuts, while also engaging in fishing, animal husbandry, and local crafts. Traditional housing in
                the region often includes round huts made of sun-dried mud and thatched or domed roofs, adapted to the
                hot and dry environment.</p>

        </section>
        <img class="image_gf1" src="Images/Cameroon/Groups/Nord.png" alt="north Culture">
        <section class="section3">

            <p>The region has a rich cultural heritage, with unique music, dances, and art. Groups like the Musgum are
                known for their distinctive clay architecture, including conical dwellings shaped like beehives. Many
                groups maintain vibrant traditional festivals, rituals, and oral traditions. Islam is the dominant
                religion, especially among the Fulani and Kotoko, but indigenous beliefs still coexist or influence
                local practices.</p>

            <p>Today, the Sudano-Sahelian zone plays an important role in Cameroon's cultural, religious, and economic
                life. However, it faces challenges such as climate change, desertification, and insecurity, particularly
                from the presence of Boko Haram in parts of the Far North. Despite these issues, the people of this
                region continue to preserve their rich cultural identity while contributing to the nation's diversity.

        <h3 class="subtitle1">Coastal (Sawa) Region</h3>
        <img class="image_gf1" src="Images/Cameroon/Groups/ngondo2.jpg" alt="Sawa festival">
        <!--<img src="Images/Cameroon/Groups/ngondo4.jpg" alt="Sawa festival">-->
        <section class="section3">
            <p>
                The Coastal group, also known as the Sawa people, live mainly along the Atlantic coast of Cameroon,
                particularly in the Littoral, Southwest, and parts of the South regions. The term “Sawa” (meaning
                “coast” in Duala) refers to a collection of ethnic groups who share historical and cultural traits
                linked to their geographic location along the coast. Major Sawa communities include the Duala, Bakweri,
                Bakoko, Basaa, Batanga, Malimba, and Isubu, among others.</p>
            <p>
                Historically, the Sawa were among the first Cameroonian groups to come into contact with European
                traders, beginning with the Portuguese in the 15th century. These coastal communities served as
                middlemen in trade between Europeans and the interior regions, dealing in goods such as ivory, palm oil,
                and later slaves. Over time, this contact led to the rise of influential coastal kingdoms, such as the
                Duala Kingdom and the Bimbia Kingdom, which developed strong political and economic structures under
                local rulers known as kings or chiefs.</p>
            <p>
                Culturally, the Sawa people have rich traditions that blend African and European influences. Chieftaincy
                institutions are still respected today, with royal families playing ceremonial and cultural roles in
                society. One of the most important cultural events is the<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA1l4g-PM9g" target="_blank">Ngondo Festival</a> , an annual
                water-centered
                ceremony held by the Duala people to honor the spirits of the ancestors and connect with the sea. The
                festival features boat races, traditional dances, rituals, and displays of cultural pride.</p>
        </section>
        <img class="image_gf1" src="Images/Cameroon/Groups/ngondo3.jpg" alt="Sawa festival">
        <section class="section3">
        <p>
            Most Sawa communities practice Christianity, especially due to early missionary influence during the
            colonial period, but traditional beliefs and customs remain important in social life. The Sawa are also
            known for their vibrant music, dance, and clothing, with rhythms like Makossa and Assiko originating in
            the coastal areas. Fishing and trade remain key parts of their economy, along with farming and urban
            professions in cities like Douala, Cameroon's largest city and economic capital.</p>
        <p>
            Today, the Coastal group continues to play a significant role in Cameroon's political, economic, and
            cultural landscape. Despite facing challenges such as urban expansion, environmental degradation, and
            cultural erosion, the Sawa people actively work to preserve their heritage through festivals, education,
            and cultural associations.
