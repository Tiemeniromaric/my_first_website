        <h2 id="title">Cameroon History</h2>
        <p>
            Cameroon has a rich history that dates back thousands of years, with early civilizations like the Sao
            thriving near Lake Chad
            and numerous ethnic groups forming kingdoms and chiefdoms such as the Bamoun in the west and Fulani
            emirates in the north.
            European contact began with Portuguese explorers in the 15th century, but it wasn't until 1884 that
            Germany formally colonized the territory as Kamerun.
            After Germany's defeat in World War I, the land was divided between France and Britain under League of
            Nations mandates.
            French Cameroon gained independence in 1960, followed by the unification with Southern British Cameroons
            in 1961, forming the Federal Republic of Cameroon.
            The federation was abolished in 1972, creating a unitary state. Since 1982, Paul Biya has ruled the
            country, overseeing a shift to multi-party politics in the 1990s,
            though his long tenure has been marked by allegations of authoritarianism. In recent years, Cameroon has
            faced major challenges, particularly the Anglophone Crisis,
            where English-speaking regions have demanded greater autonomy or independence due to perceived
            marginalization. Despite these issues,
            Cameroon remains a culturally rich and strategically important country in Central Africa, with over 250
            ethnic groups and both French and English as official languages.

        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Origine of The Name Cameroon</h3>
        <p>
            The name Cameroon originates from the Portuguese word "Camarões," which means "shrimps" or "prawns."
            When Portuguese explorers arrived on the coast of present-day Cameroon in the 15th century,
            they sailed up the Wouri River (near present-day Douala). There, they encountered an abundance of giant
            freshwater shrimp.
            In 1472, the Portuguese navigator Fernão do Pó (also known as Fernão do Poo) named the river "Rio dos
            Camarões" , meaning "River of Shrimps."
            <br>
            Over time, this name evolved through different languages:
        <ul>
            <li> The Spanish called it “Camarones”</li>
            <li>The Germans later adopted “Kamerun” during their colonization</li>
            <li>The French used “Cameroun”</li>
            <li>The English version became “Cameroon”</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle"> Before Colonization </h3>
        <p>
            Before colonization, the territory now known as Cameroon was home to a wide range of ethnic groups,
            kingdoms, and civilizations, each with its own unique culture,
            language, and political systems. One of the earliest known civilizations was the Sao culture, which
            thrived around Lake Chad from about the 6th to the 15th century,
            leaving behind impressive artifacts and architecture. In the north, powerful Islamic states such as the
            Kanem-Bornu Empire and later the Adamawa Emirate (established by the Fulani during the 19th-century
            jihads)
            dominated trade and politics, spreading Islam and maintaining vast networks across West and Central
            Africa.</p>
        <p>
            In the west and central highlands, ethnic groups like the Bamileke, Bamoun, and Tikar developed
            centralized kingdoms with complex social hierarchies, strong military structures,
            and vibrant artistic traditions. The Bamoun Kingdom, for example, was known for its skilled diplomacy,
            military strength, and unique script created by Sultan Njoya in the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>
            Along the coast, the Duala people established themselves as key middlemen in trade between the interior
            and European merchants. By the 15th century, Portuguese explorers arrived,
            followed by the Dutch, British, and French, trading goods such as ivory, palm oil, and later slaves.
            Despite growing European contact, local rulers maintained political control for centuries,
            adapting to and influencing external relationships.</p>
        <p>
            Cameroon's pre-colonial period was thus marked by diversity, trade, migration, and cultural development,
            laying the foundations for the complex society that would later experience European colonization in the
            late 19th century.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">During Colonization (1884-1960)</h3>
        <p>
            Cameroon's colonial period began in 1884 when Germany signed treaties with local chiefs along the coast,
            officially establishing the colony of Kamerun. The Germans expanded their control inland,
            developing infrastructure such as roads, railways, and plantations, especially for cocoa, bananas, and
            rubber. However, their rule was harsh,marked by forced labor, land seizures,
            and violent suppression of resistance, including uprisings by the Bassa, Bakoko, and Ewondo peoples.</p>
        <p>
            After Germany's defeat in World War I, its colonies were divided among the victorious powers. In 1919,
            Kamerun was split into two parts: French Cameroon, which took the majority of the territory, and British
            Cameroon,
            which was administered in two parts (Northern and Southern Cameroons) alongside Nigeria.
            This division was formalized under League of Nations mandates, later becoming United Nations Trust
            Territories after World War II.</p>
        <p>
            French Cameroon was governed as part of France's assimilationist colonial system, with tighter control
            and centralized administration.
            British Cameroons, in contrast, were ruled indirectly through Nigerian colonial structures, receiving
            less investment in development.
            During this time, nationalist movements began to grow. In French Cameroon, the Union des Populations du
            Cameroun (UPC), founded in 1948,
            called for independence and reunification of the divided territories, but it was banned in 1955, leading
            to an armed uprising that was brutally suppressed.</p>
        <p>
            By the late 1950s, under increasing pressure from nationalist groups and the global push for
            decolonization, France agreed to grant independence.
            French Cameroon became independent on January 1, 1960, with Ahmadou Ahidjo as its first president.
            In 1961, Southern British Cameroons voted in a UN-organized plebiscite to join the newly independent
            Cameroon, marking the beginning of reunification.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Independence and Early Years(1960-1972)</h3>
        <p>
            Cameroon gained independence from France on January 1, 1960, becoming the Republic of Cameroon with
            Ahmadou Ahidjo as its first president.
            Ahidjo focused on building national unity, economic development, and centralizing power. On October 1,
            1961, following a UN-organized plebiscite,
            the British-administered Southern Cameroons voted to join the Republic of Cameroon, while Northern
            Cameroons chose to join Nigeria.
            This led to the creation of the Federal Republic of Cameroon, consisting of East Cameroon (Francophone)
            and West Cameroon (Anglophone), each with a degree of autonomy.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Craetion of Unitary State (1972)</h3>
        <p>
            In 1972, a national referendum abolished the federal system, and Cameroon became a unitary state known
            as the United Republic of Cameroon.
            This change was intended to promote unity but also reduced the autonomy of the Anglophone regions,
            planting seeds of future discontent.
            Ahidjo continued to rule with a centralized and authoritarian style, maintaining stability but limiting
            political freedoms.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Transition of Power and Biya's Rise (1982-1900)</h3>
        <p>
            In 1982, President Ahidjo unexpectedly resigned and handed power to his Prime Minister, Paul Biya.
            Though the transition was peaceful, tensions later grew between Ahidjo and Biya.
            Biya faced early challenges, including a failed coup attempt in 1984. That same year, the country was
            renamed the Republic of Cameroon, and the name of the state returned to its pre-1961 form,
            further alienating many in the Anglophone regions.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Multi-Party Politics and Political Tensions (1990s-2000s)</h3>
        <p>
            Mounting pressure from the public and the international community led to a return to multi-party
            democracy in 1990.
            The first multi-party presidential election was held in 1992, but it was marred by allegations of fraud.
            Paul Biya and his party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM),
            have remained in power ever since through elections that are regularly criticized for lacking
            transparency and fairness.
            During this period, Cameroon experienced some economic reforms and infrastructure development, but
            widespread corruption and authoritarian practices persisted.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Anglophone Crisis (2016-Present)</h3>
        <p>
            Since 2016, tensions between the Anglophone regions (Northwest and Southwest) and the central government
            have escalated into a serious conflict.
            What began as peaceful protests by Anglophone lawyers and teachers against marginalization and the
            dominance of French in courts and schools turned into an armed struggle.
            Separatist groups declared an independent state called Ambazonia, leading to violent clashes with
            government forces, human rights abuses, internal displacement, and a humanitarian crisis.
            Dialogue attempts have so far been limited and largely unsuccessful.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Recents Developments (2020s-Present)</h3>
        <p>
            President Paul Biya, now in his 93s, remains in power as one of the world's longest-serving heads of
            state. His government continues to face criticism for lack of democratic reforms, suppression of
            dissent, and mishandling of the Anglophone crisis. Despite challenges, Cameroon maintains relative
            stability compared to some of its neighbors and plays an important role in Central African regional
            politics.
            <br>
            At the same time, the country deals with economic difficulties, youth unemployment, corruption, and
            security threats from Boko Haram in the Far North. Calls for political transition, peaceful dialogue,
            and inclusive governance continue to grow as the country looks to its future.
